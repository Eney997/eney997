# Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm eney01

## ðŸ’¡ About Me

I keep learning and pushing my skills in **Assembly**, **C**, and **C++**, focusing on how software talks to hardware and manages memory. I pay attention to what happens under the hood-from CPU instructions and registers to system calls and optimized algorithms.

I also keep growing in Android development with **Kotlin** and **Jetpack Compose**, building apps that are intuitive and responsive, while following modern design patterns, managing lifecycle and resources, and exploring libraries and best practices to deliver high-quality applications.
